# Bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis

The main purpose of this analysis is to show the results of the NYC City Bike with august 2019 data through Tableau. We are going to be able to show our results with a Tableau story which will make our analysis easier to understand with the aid of interactive visualizations and graphs that make easier to understand and therefore to make decisions.

## Results

The following points show the findigns and results of the analysis:

![Chekout time for users](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83261520/133545604-1b4104c9-bbb2-404a-94d8-82929b16a425.png)

- The great majority of trips last less than 1 hour, with 5 minutes been the maximum point of duration of the number of trips with 146,752 registered.

![Chekout time for users by gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83261520/133545608-a9418be0-9f46-4153-a28a-1b489a0732a3.png)

- Gender is not relevenat for the amount of time a bike is used as they remain within the same range of minutes per trip, however it is clear that male users use the service more often.

![Trips by weekday per hour](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83261520/133545625-1e8a7fda-3ca3-4951-af21-38f0d724703c.png)

- On business days, there is more demand of bikes from 6 AM to 9 AM with a maximum of 36,514 rides and from 4 PM to 8 PM with a maximum of 44,905 rides. During weekends, there is a relatively contstant demand between 10 AM and 7 PM with an average of aproximately 20,000 rides every hour.

- When it comes to gender there is no much difference on the hours on which a bike is used. On business days there is more demand during the start of the workday and at the end of it and during the weekends there is more demand between 10 AM and 7 PM.

![User trips by gender by weekday ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83261520/133545639-994f305d-6567-472c-a011-87a84e335b63.png)

- When it comes to the users, there are more subscirbers than regular customers that take bike trips, however subscribers have more demand of the service during business days (monday - friday) while regular customers prefer to use the service during weekends mostly.

- The area where most of the bike trips start is the southern part of Manhattan.

![Top ending locations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83261520/133545658-70d91ac7-69ff-4cda-8761-b9a3137b714a.png)

- Just as with the starting locations, the area where most of the bike trips end is the southern part of Manhattan.

## Summary

Most of the recorded bike rides during august 2019 lasted less than 1 hour, 5-6 minutes its the range of time that most of trips last. The time of the day where most of the bikes are used on businnes days is before and after work, while during weekends the demand is less than business days but its usage is relatively constant from 10 AM to 7 PM. Subscribers use the service often during business days while regular customers uses it mostly on weekends. Southern area of Manhattan is where most of the trips take place. Most of the users of the service are male, however the behavior of the analysed data does not show any particular difference based on gender.


Two additional visualizations that could be helpfull for future analysis could be:

1. Tripduration by type of user.
2. Range of age of subscribers and customers
